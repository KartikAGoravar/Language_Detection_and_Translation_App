# Language_Detection_and_Translation_App
Created an interactive NLP-based web application using Streamlit that performs multilingual translation and voice processing. It includes four core modules:  
- Real-time Language Translation  
- File Reading and Translation  
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)  
- Speech-to-Text (STT)  

This project showcased end-to-end integration of NLP models, Python speech libraries, and UI development for real-time, accessible translation solutions.
